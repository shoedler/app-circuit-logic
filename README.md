# Sorting Algorithms
View, and listen to different sorting algorithms

## Todos
- [ ] Writeup README
- [ ] Package json description
- [x] Add Sound
- [x] Add MergeSort, RadixSort and ShellSort
- [ ] UI: Hide Dropdown when sorting is running
- [x] UI: Fix Bar Labels overlapping
- [ ] UI: Center Buttons
- [ ] UI: Add slider for Array Count + Reload on change
- [x] Do not generate a new array when 'cancel' is used
- [ ] Check all `TODO (classification)` Comments - some situations in the sorting algos probably need additional functionality in `observableArray`. This is just to make sure the displayed "stats" are correct.
- [x] Find a way to pass current settings to "reload"
- [ ] In the delay slider callback, set animation time to 0.05, if the smallest delay is selected. Otherwise use the default, pretty looking 0.1

## Usage
- Run `npm ci`
- Run `npm run start`
